# Proof Blockchain Validators (Layer 2)

## Overview

Proof Blockchain Validators represents the Layer 2 implementation of the Proof Blockchain ecosystem. This repository focuses on high-performance scalability solutions, including sharding, cross-chain interactions, and efficient smart contract execution. It is a crucial component that enables Proof Blockchain to achieve high throughput, low latency, and seamless interoperability with other blockchain networks.

## Features

- **Sharding Implementation**: Horizontal scaling through efficient data partitioning
- **XX Protocol**: High-performance transaction processing and smart contract execution
- **YY Protocol**: Cross-chain interactions and altcoin integration
- **Validator Node Logic**: Implementation of validator selection, staking, and rewards
- **PBFT Consensus**: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus for shards
- **Smart Contract VM**: Efficient virtual machine for smart contract execution

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.55.0 or later
- Cargo
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/proof-blockchain/proof-validators.git
   cd proof-validators
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Usage

To run a validator node:

```
cargo run --release -- --config-path /path/to/config.toml
```

Make sure to configure your `config.toml` file with appropriate settings for your validator node.

## Configuration

The `config.toml` file should include the following sections:

- `[network]`: P2P network configuration
- `[consensus]`: Consensus parameters
- `[sharding]`: Sharding configuration
- `[xx_protocol]`: XX Protocol settings
- `[yy_protocol]`: YY Protocol settings
- `[smart_contracts]`: Smart contract execution parameters

Refer to the `config.example.toml` file in the repository for a complete example.

## Architecture

The proof-validators repository is structured as follows:

- `src/validator/`: Core validator logic
- `src/xx_protocol/`: Implementation of the XX Protocol
- `src/yy_protocol/`: Implementation of the YY Protocol
- `src/smart_contracts/`: Smart contract execution engine
- `src/consensus/`: PBFT consensus implementation
- `src/network/`: P2P networking and communication
- `src/storage/`: State storage and management
